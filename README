Task:

Fill elasticsearch with data from assets folder.
Parse the text files using this logic:

1672896929.432 1295 185.250.242.119 TCP_TUNNEL/200 5397 CONNECT api.twitter.com:443 dogansahin-dc-any HIER_DIRECT/api.twitter.com - 202.142.72.26 1785 15.235.51.169 104.244.42.130

0 element - timestamp
4 element - total size
6 element - url
7 element - customer name

Create a web server that has the following endpoints:

POST /insert
GET /aggregate

Insert endpoint:

- Should accept json data
- Insert data into elasticsearch
- Performance is key, should be optimized to insert large amounts of data.
- should return 200 if successful

Aggregate endpoint:

- Should accept:

* Date range (Filter by date)
* Customer name(Filter by customer - optional)

- Should return aggregated by customer name, date and url.

* Total request size
* Total log records

Example output:
[
{
"customer_name": "dogansahin-dc-any",
"date": "2024-06-01",
"url": "api.twitter.com",
"total_requests_size": 100000,
"requests_count": 1000
},
{
"customer_name": "customer 2",
"date": "2024-06-01",
"url": "other domain",
"total_requests_size": 999,
"requests_count": 99
},
]
